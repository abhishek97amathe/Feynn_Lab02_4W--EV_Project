# Feynn_Lab02_4-Wheeler-EV_Project

This project analyzes the growth and trends of four-wheeler electric vehicles (EVs) in India using data on vehicle categories, state-wise sales, and charging infrastructure.

## Project Structure

- **4W-EV Analysis.ipynb**: Main Jupyter Notebook containing all data analysis, visualizations, and conclusions.
- **ev_cat.csv**: Dataset with EV sales by category and date.
- **state_sales.xlsx**: State-wise EV sales data.
- **ev sales& charging.xlsx**: State-wise EV sales and charging station data.
- **4w_cat.xlsx**: Category-wise sales data for 4W EVs.

## Key Analyses

- Yearly and quarterly trends in EV sales.
- Growth rates of different EV categories.
- State-wise EV adoption and infrastructure.
- Comparison of sales among vehicle categories (LMV, 4WIC, etc.).
- Relationship between charging stations and EV sales.

## Main Findings

- EV sales are increasing every year in India.
- Light Motor Vehicles (LMV) show the fastest growth.
- Maharashtra, Uttar Pradesh, and Karnataka lead in EV sales.
- States with more charging stations generally have higher EV sales.
- Some categories (MMV, HMV) have almost no sales.
- The EV market is expanding rapidly, especially in certain states and categories.

## How to Run

1. Clone this repository.
2. Make sure you have Python 3.x and Jupyter Notebook installed.
3. Install required libraries:
    ```bash
    pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn openpyxl
    ```
4. Place all data files in the same directory as the notebook.
5. Open and run `4W-EV Analysis.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook.

## Visualization Samples

- Bar plots of EV sales by year and state.
- Line plots showing category-wise growth.
- Scatter plots of sales vs. charging stations.
